# Cipher Tool (Updated) 🔐

## Overview

-Cipher Tool is a CLI Tool **command-line cryptography utility** written in Python. It allows users to **encode and decode messages** using common encoding schemes. 
-This tool is designed for educational purposes only, quick transformations, and lightweight usage directly from the terminal.
-The project is currently under developement **Release Candidate (v0.2.0)** and focuses on simplicity rather than advanced cryptographic security which will be added very soon.
