# Cipher Tool

## Overview

Cipher Tool is a CLI Tool **command-line cryptography utility** written in Python. It allows users to **encode and decode messages** using common encoding schemes such as **Base64**, **Base16 (Hex)**, and **ROT13**. The tool is designed for educational purposes only, quick transformations, and lightweight usage directly from the terminal.

The project is currently under developement **beta (v0.1.1)** and focuses on simplicity rather than advanced cryptographic security which will be added very soon.
